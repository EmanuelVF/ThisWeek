## Privacy

The following Privacy Policy applies to Seven Days, developed bye Emanuel Villa Fernandez.

_The Short Version_
If upon setting up your phone or adjusting your phone’s settings, you already opted into sharing data with Apple, then that means Apple shares anonymous data with me. It includes absolutely no personal data. No names, physical addresses, email addresses, device IDs, or other similar info is provided to me by Apple. The anonymous data provided describes general metrics such as number of users, number of crashes, and other non-user-specific metrics.
 
If you email me feedback, that is likely the most personal information I’ll ever have! Any kind of data is collected by Seven Days directly. All your data is saved in your phone or in your iCloud account. No information is ever collected to sell.

-Emanuel
